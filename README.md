# Bulls_And_Cows
My first version of the "Bulls and Cows" game in C++.  The game prompts the player to guess an isogram that is stored in the code and gives feedback in "bulls" and "cows" until the player guesses correctly. I plan to add a larger pool of words from which the program can randomly pull from in a future version.

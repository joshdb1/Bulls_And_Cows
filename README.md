# Bulls_And_Cows
My first version of the "Bulls and Cows" game in C++.  The game prompts the player to guess an isogram that is stored in the code and gives feedback in "bulls" and "cows" until the player guesses correctly or they run out of turns. I plan to add a larger pool of words from which the program can randomly pull in a future version.
*note that I made this game as part of an online C++ course and it uses Unreal Engine coding standards.*
